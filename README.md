This project is built with React, based on [the YouTube tutorial by Smoljames](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iKpkVKubvKk).

The CSS styles were pre-written as part of the starter project (with a few tweaks).

I’ve added some functionality — users can now search for a specific Pokémon by name or ID.
